# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Initially I was asked to analyze student funding and standardized test score data to help inform decision making at school and district levels. The school board has become aware that there is evidence of academic dishonesty in the data reported by Thomas High School for ninth graders. I have been tasked with replacing the math and reading scores with NANs while keeping the rest of the data intact. They would like the school district analysis to be repeated.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv

## Results
### District Summary
Compared to the initial district summary, I found the following:
-	The average math score reduced from 79 to 78.9.
-	The average reading score reduced from 81.9 to 78.9.
-	The percent of students passing math reduced from 75% to 74.8%.
-	The percent of students passing reading reduced from 86% to 85.7%.
-	The overall percent of students passing both math and reading reduced from 65% to 64.9%.

### Thomas High School’s Performance 
- Replacing the data for ninth graders does not affect the standing of Thomas High School compared to other schools in terms of rank. Despite the reduction in overall passing percentage in the second school district analysis, Thomas High School is still ranked as the # 2 performing school in the district.

## Summary 
Math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects, have slightly reduced for the school district when removing 9th grade scores from Thomas High School’s data. In the school summary, we can see that for Thomas High School, the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects has increased after removing 9th grade data. There are very minimal but negligible changes to school spending per student bin $630-644, medium school size, and charter school type categories. Replacing the ninth grade data for math and reading does not affect Thomas High Schools rank.
